# Kiet — Music & Interests Page

This is a simple, fully static website tailored to show your music taste and interests.
You can deploy **for free** on Glitch, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Neocities — no custom domain needed.

## Quick customize
- Edit `index.html` text (music lists, gear, links, email).
- Change theme color: in `style.css`, set `--accent` to your favorite.
- Replace the avatar with an image: swap the `.avatar` div with an `<img>` tag.

## Embeds
- Replace the Spotify/TIDAL `src` with your own playlist/share links.

## Deploy (Glitch)
1. Sign in at https://glitch.com → New Project → Hello‑webpage.
2. Upload `index.html` and `style.css` (replace the defaults).
3. Share your `https://PROJECT.glitch.me` link.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create repo `USERNAME.github.io` and upload files.
2. Site appears at `https://USERNAME.github.io` shortly.

(You can also drag‑drop the folder into https://app.netlify.com/ for `https://SITENAME.netlify.app`.)

Enjoy!
